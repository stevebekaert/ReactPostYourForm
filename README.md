This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

App.js render a MovieForm component. This one updates its state and onSubmit, transform the state (object) into a JSON and sent it to heroku api. This API send back an answer that we alert and also change a state in this component ('sent') allowing to show a custom message in a div.
